        "message": "Many thanks from our entire family and personally from Caspar David, Anastasia @AnastasiaBelykh. In all (not the easiest) situations, Anastasia was there, giving advice and helping in the most critical moments! In the spring, Anastasia and I arranged the departure from Dubai back to Russia, and considering that we had to do it with my 5-year-old son, as he couldn't bear to be separated from Caspi for even a short while üôà, it was a heroic day! Anastasia even treated the child to delicious homemade cheesecakes ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. But the biggest challenge was upon our return to the UAE a few days ago, from which we are still recovering. Endless stress, over 20 calls and emails a day to Etihad Airways for three days (because there was no response regarding the documents)... A day before the flight, when we were traveling on the train from St. Petersburg to Moscow (almost without connection), we found out that titers were required (which were not needed because the vaccination was administered in the UAE), and it was only with Anastasia's help that we managed to figure out that there was an error in the documents, and our chances were extremely slim!",

Anastasia organized everything 'turnkey' and brought our kitty all the way from Khabarovsk.The journey was quite a distance: a flight from Khabarovsk to Moscow (in the cabin) and then Moscow to Dubai (cargo). Anastasia organized everything in the shortest possible time, sent a wonderful pet courier to pick up the cat, arranged an overnight stay in Moscow for her to rest, and then personally went through all the checks in Dubai and brought her straight to our home.The cat handled all these flights calmly, and she is now doing great and getting used to her new home.A huge thank you to Anastasia! Everything was fast, precise, and of high quality. Special thanks for the support, answering my numerous questions, and providing photo updates. In the end, everything went perfectly, and it was not scary at all. Once again, heartfelt thanks and a big recommendation!",

        "question": "How will my pet be transported?",
        "answer": "There are two most common ways to transport a pet:\n1) In cabin (so that your pet is all the time accompanied by you or our employee). This is the way to go for small pets, and in general the weight limit is up to 8 kg with carrier. As an exception, service dogs are sometimes allowed to travel in cabin regardless of their size, when they accompany a passenger with disability.\n2) In hold (most often when the pet is too large to fit in cabin or needs to travel unaccompanied). Typically, pets are transported on the same aircrafts, as humans, in a specialized and safe cargo compartment. Here are the two options of transporting pets in hold:\n- Manifest cargo. For flights to the UAE it is typically required that  pets are transported as manifest cargo (which requires additional paperwork and clearance procedures). You may travel on the same flight, but you don't have to.\n- Checked-in baggage. When you travel from the UAE, you may take your pet as baggage, which allows significant time saving on clearance procedures. It is also way cheaper, as the rates are way lower. Don't worry, that is not the same as carrying a suitcase, and your pet will not be surrounded by bags during it's journey. In any airport there are specific rules on live animals handling which ensure safety."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is it better to transport a pet?",
        "answer": "Briefly - there is no right or wrong answer here. For some pets presence of mom and dad around is absolutely critical, and for some its actually easier to fly alone. In general, if you are under high stress, it might be beneficial to send pet as cargo - they do feel our anxiety during relocations. From some destination a direct flight in cargo is available, and compared to multiple stopovers of in-cabin transportation this may be easier. We are happy to support you in decision-making depending on your individual case."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it safe to transport pets in cargo hold?",
        "answer": "In terms of safety, transportation in hold is performed by airlines in accordance with IATA regulations, and is safe for animals. The specific temperature regime in hold may depend upon the specific aircraft that you will be using, however, it is always an acceptable temperature for your beloved ones. As for the airline, everything is also individual and depends on your destination."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I prepare my pet for relocation?",
        "answer": "Basically, for nearly all destinations you will need to microchip your pet and do the annual vaccines. In terms of other requirements - they will depend on the destination of your journey, and may include various tests and health check ups. It is very useful to get an advice from a relocation agent before getting any extra tests done. This will allow to prevent excessive costs (and tests which you don't need), and at the same time be fully ready for the journey. Typically, after the microchip and vaccines, right before your journey (a few days in advance) you will need to obtain additional health certificates, but this part usually does not require long term planning.  We will assist you throughout the process so that everything is clear and under control."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which medications should I give to my pet before the flight?",
        "answer": "In general, it is advised not to give any extra medications. However, it always makes sense to get an advice from your veterinarian, if there are any heart or stress-related conditions that may require additional attention."
      },
      {
        "question": "How far in advance should I plan the relocation of my pet?",
        "answer": "It's advisable to start planning as early as possible, especially for certain destinations. The preparation period may be above 6 months, but we will be happy to accommodate last-minute requests when necessary and possible."
      },
      {
        "question": "What services does your pet relocation company offer?",
        "answer": "We offer a wide range of services, which allow you to travel together with your pet or order door-to-door relocation service depending on your destination and personal preferences."
