        "message": "Many thanks from our entire family and personally from Caspar David, Anastasia @AnastasiaBelykh. In all (not the easiest) situations, Anastasia was there, giving advice and helping in the most critical moments! In the spring, Anastasia and I arranged the departure from Dubai back to Russia, and considering that we had to do it with my 5-year-old son, as he couldn't bear to be separated from Caspi for even a short while üôà, it was a heroic day! Anastasia even treated the child to delicious homemade cheesecakes ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. But the biggest challenge was upon our return to the UAE a few days ago, from which we are still recovering. Endless stress, over 20 calls and emails a day to Etihad Airways for three days (because there was no response regarding the documents)... A day before the flight, when we were traveling on the train from St. Petersburg to Moscow (almost without connection), we found out that titers were required (which were not needed because the vaccination was administered in the UAE), and it was only with Anastasia's help that we managed to figure out that there was an error in the documents, and our chances were extremely slim!",

Anastasia organized everything 'turnkey' and brought our kitty all the way from Khabarovsk.The journey was quite a distance: a flight from Khabarovsk to Moscow (in the cabin) and then Moscow to Dubai (cargo). Anastasia organized everything in the shortest possible time, sent a wonderful pet courier to pick up the cat, arranged an overnight stay in Moscow for her to rest, and then personally went through all the checks in Dubai and brought her straight to our home.The cat handled all these flights calmly, and she is now doing great and getting used to her new home.A huge thank you to Anastasia! Everything was fast, precise, and of high quality. Special thanks for the support, answering my numerous questions, and providing photo updates. In the end, everything went perfectly, and it was not scary at all. Once again, heartfelt thanks and a big recommendation!",

I want to officially declare that this photo was made possible thanks to Anastasia @AnastasiaBelykh))We are among the very anxious owners who fear making mistakes at every turn and having their dog not allowed on the plane. But thanks to Anastasia's patience, attentiveness, and ability to clearly communicate information and plan the timely receipt of all documents, everything went very smoothly üòä. She explained everything, reassured us, and gave us a nudge when needed üòÇ. As a result, transporting our little one went wonderfully, without nerves or breakdowns (except for the flight delay, which unfortunately is not within her control))) Thousand thanks from us and a bunch of recommendations to all our acquaintances üòçü´∂.",
